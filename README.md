# 🏥 Skin Cancer Classification using Deep Learning  

## 🚀 Abstract  
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer but is highly curable when detected early. Current diagnostic methods involve clinical screening, dermoscopic analysis, and histopathological examination, achieving **75-84% accuracy** with expert intervention. This project aims to develop an **AI-driven automated classification system** using **deep learning (CNNs)** and **computer vision** to enhance melanoma detection from skin lesion images. By leveraging image processing techniques, the goal is to support dermatologists in **faster and more accurate melanoma diagnosis**.  

## 📌 Introduction & Background  
Melanoma accounts for **75% of skin cancer-related deaths**, despite being one of the least common types. Early diagnosis is crucial for survival. The **International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)** has provided a large dataset to advance AI-based melanoma detection and reduce mortality rates. This project integrates **deep learning and computer vision** to enhance early detection, improving diagnostic efficiency and decision-making in dermatology.  

## 🛠️ Problem Statement  
Currently, melanoma detection involves **biopsies**, taking **weeks** from appointment to diagnosis. This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD)** to classify **nine types of skin cancer**, drastically reducing the diagnostic process to just a **few seconds**. The AI model aids dermatologists in making **faster, more accurate predictions**, minimizing unnecessary biopsies and improving patient outcomes.  

## 🎯 Motivation  
✔ Reduce melanoma-related deaths through **early AI-based detection**.  
✔ Leverage **computer vision and deep learning** for scalable diagnosis.  
✔ Support dermatologists with an **AI-powered clinical decision-support system**.  
✔ Improve **accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility** of melanoma diagnosis worldwide.  

## 💡 Application  
A **user-friendly web interface** allows dermatologists and patients to upload **demographic data & lesion images**. The model processes the input and returns **instantaneous** classification results. To **educate and assist users**, an infographic section provides **detailed information** on melanoma detection and the usage of this AI-based tool.  

## 📊 Dataset
